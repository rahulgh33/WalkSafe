# WalkSafe: Safety-Aware Routing

One of our most common concerns as a college student is our own safety. Staying up late and then walking home at night can be a daunting experience. We want to make sure that students feel safe walking home. We recommend the safest possible routes, utilizing city data. We take violent crime, nearby lighting, and distance to emergency centers into consideration to curate the best route. 

## How to Run

1. Open the `safe_path_test.py` script.
2. Set your desired start and end coordinates on the following lines:

```python
start_coords = (41.7796, -87.6636)  # West Garfield Park  
end_coords = (41.7681, -87.6435)    # Austin
```

## Results

1. Output will be stored in `multi_lambda_paths_map.html`
2. Type `open multi_lambda_paths_map.html` in your terminal to open it
